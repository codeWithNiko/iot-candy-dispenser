# IOT Candy Dispencer

## What is it ?
An angular and node app + raspberry pi that uses a real candy dispenser to give you candy if you answer correctly to a question

## Development server
Build the app ```ng build --prod``` copy the files to server dist/candyDis that way we can serve the files from the server.

The server is in the server folder run npm install + you'll need to add 'onoff' on your own because:
```Note that although it's possible to install onoff on non-Linux systems the functionality offered by onoff is only available on Linux systems.```

to run the server just: ```node .\app.js```
